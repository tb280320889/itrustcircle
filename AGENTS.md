# itrustcircle - Agent Guidance

## Non-negotiables
- Guardian Core reliability > UI. UI may crash; Guardian Core must keep running.
- Capacitor workflow: web build -> cap sync -> run/open. Never hand-edit copied web assets in native projects.

## Key directories (suggested)
- src/ : SvelteKit UI
- android/ : Android native + Guardian runtime
- ios/ : iOS native (later)
- .claude/skills : linked from ai-infra

## Commands (update to your actual scripts)
- pnpm dev
- pnpm build:web
- pnpm cap:sync
- pnpm cap:android

## Acceptance (MVP)
- BLE disconnect triggers countdown; if not cancelled -> AlertEvent queued and sent to Tower.
- Weak/No network: queue persists and flushes on recovery.
- Tower stores to SQLite and sends Email successfully.
- Diagnostics exports recent logs + config summary.
